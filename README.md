# ReactJS Weather App

This is a **dockerized** project using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, luxon, unicons, and react-toastify to create an exceptional application. The primary focus is on fetching weather data from OpenWeather endpoints, including:
- Temperature
- Maximum and minimum temperatures
- Humidity
- Real feel
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Hourly and daily forecasts

Additionally, the application will display the local time of the selected location. 

For user input, the application provides convenient quick links along with a search box for querying a specific city and a feature for searching based on the user's current location.
